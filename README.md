Blog It
======================

This MVC-based application demonstrates a number of design patterns and advanced web development techniques using popular .NET and open source tools and frameworks.  All content is for illustrative purposes only.

The app presents screens to manage a group of authors posting and commenting on a set of blogs.  Models are contrived and very basic - the intent is just to demonstrate various patterns and concepts.

In addition to the main "Blog It" functionality, I've also added a "Misc" directory which includes a wide variety of demos and experiments for various technologies.

Some of the design patterns and technologies used include:

- Modern web development using Bootstrap and the MVC 5 framework
- Dependency injection via Autofac
- Object-relational mapping (ORM) using Entity Framework
- Repository data access pattern
- SOAP web services using WCF
- RESTful services using Web API
- OData services using Web API
- Object mapping using AutoMapper
- Asyncronous server and client operations
- Unit testing with xUnit and Jasmine
- Modular javascript design
- HTML5 local storage & web workers
- Real-time updates with SignalR
- Reactive extensions for Javascript
- Demos of libraries like D3, Winjs, etc.
