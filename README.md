My Blog
======================

This MVC-based application demonstrates a number of design patterns and advanced web development techniques using popular .NET and open source tools and frameworks.  All content is for illustrative purposes only.

The app presents screens to manage a group of authors posting and commenting on a set of blogs.  Models are contrived and very basic - the intent is just to demonstrate various patterns and concepts.

Several views demonstrating some of Bootstrap's capabilities are also presented.  These examples contain static markup and are included as examples only.

Some of the design patterns and technologies used include:

- Modern web development using Bootstrap and the MVC 5 framework
- Dependency injection via Autofac
- Object-relational mapping (ORM) using Entity Framework
- Repository data access pattern
- SOAP web services using WCF
- RESTful services using Web API
- OData services using Web API
- Object mapping using AutoMapper
- Asyncronous server and client operations
