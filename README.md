MVC web application where I experiment with a number of different technologies and design patterns, including:

- Modern web development using Bootstrap and the MVC 5 framework
- Dependency injection via Autofac
- Object-relational mapping (ORM) using Entity Framework
- Repository data access pattern
- SOAP web services using WCF
- RESTful services using Web API
- OData services using Web API
- Object mapping using AutoMapper
