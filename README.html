<h1>Blog It</h1>

<p>This MVC-based application demonstrates a number of design patterns and advanced web development techniques using popular .NET and open source tools and frameworks.  All content is for illustrative purposes only.</p>

<p>The app presents screens to manage a group of authors posting and commenting on a set of blogs.  Models are contrived and very basic - the intent is just to demonstrate various patterns and concepts.</p>

<p>In addition to the main "Blog It" functionality, I've also added a "Misc" directory which includes a wide variety of demos and experiments for various technologies.</p>

<p>Some of the design patterns and technologies used include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modern web development using Bootstrap and the MVC 5 framework</li>
<li>Dependency injection via Autofac</li>
<li>Object-relational mapping (ORM) using Entity Framework</li>
<li>Repository data access pattern</li>
<li>SOAP web services using WCF</li>
<li>RESTful services using Web API</li>
<li>OData services using Web API</li>
<li>Object mapping using AutoMapper</li>
<li>Asyncronous server and client operations</li>
<li>Unit testing with xUnit and Jasmine</li>
<li>Modular javascript design</li>
<li>HTML5 local storage &amp; web workers</li>
<li>Real-time updates with SignalR</li>
<li>Reactive extensions for Javascript</li>
<li>Demos of libraries like D3, Winjs, etc.</li>
</ul>
